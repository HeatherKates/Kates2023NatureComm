## Input Data Files:

* TipStates.csv: The file of RNS presence/absence/? tip states. Tips are labeled by sequencing plate and well and not taxonomy, which can be linked to taxonomy using Supplementary Table 2

* Phylogeny.WithoutTaxonLabels.tree: The phylogeny shown in Figure 1. This is the Nitrogen-fixing clade phylogeny isnerted into the Rosid phylogeny as described in the manuscript. In this file, tips are labeled with sequencing plate and well for use with TipStates.csv

* Phylogeny.WithTaxonLabels.tree: The same phylogeny as Phylogeny.WithoutTaxonLabels.tree, but sequencing plate and well has been converted to taxonomy labels using Supplementary Table 2. This was used for figure creation in [move file to repo and reference here],
